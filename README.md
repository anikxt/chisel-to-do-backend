# How to view my to-do assignment!

1. Install all dependencies using `npm install`
2. Clone the backend file repository to local, Go to Config/Datastores.js, and edit the Adapater with your local Postgres Database server and It would just work fine.
3. Start the backend server using `sails lift`
4. Start React using npm start and you'd be able to see my task.
